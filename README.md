# Datastructures

## StackC
Stack implementation in C

A Stack is a datastructure that abites to the last in first out (LIFO) principle.

There are 3 commands that can be called on an stack: 

peek - shows what is currently on top of the stack
pop - returns the top element on the stack and removes it
push - adds element on top of the stack

This is my take on implementing such a Datastructure.
